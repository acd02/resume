### <PencilIcon>What I Do</PencilIcon>

---

Mostly, I build user interfaces, whether for single page apps, or traditional websites.

I like using design systems (because it's just easier to maintain and it scales better).
I actually worked on [one](https://sparkui.vercel.app) at my current company.

Also, when the design system is developed with accessibility in mind, the apps built on top will be more accessible by default.

When it comes to testing, writing them sure isn't always a walk in the park, but I know they're valuable. On a regular basis, they actually help me catch mistakes before they go live <span aria-hidden="true">💣</span>.

Mistakes or regressions, and those can show up fast when doing some refactoring or simply when a lot of people interact with the codebase.
