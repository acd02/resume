### <PencilIcon>What I Do</PencilIcon>

---

Mostly, I build user interfaces, whether it be for single page apps, or traditional websites.

I like using design systems (because it's just easier to maintain and it scales better).
I actually work on [one](https://sparkui.vercel.app/?path=/docs/getting-started--docs) at my current company

When it comes to testing, writing them sure isn't always a walk in the park, but I know they're valuable. On a regular basis, they actually help me catch mistakes before they go live üí£.

Mistakes or regressions, and those can show up fast when doing some refactoring or simply when a lot of people interact with the codebase.
