### <PencilIcon>What I Do</PencilIcon>

---

Mostly, I build user interfaces, whether it be for single page apps, or traditional websites.

I like using design systems (because it's just easier to maintain and it scales better).

Can't say I'm having a blast while writing tests üòÖ, but I know they're valuable, and on a regular basis, they actually help me catch stuff that otherwise would've make their way into prod üí£.

When I say _stuff_, I'm not necessarily talking about runtime errors, but also unhandled edge cases and whatnot.

And those can show up fast ‚ö°Ô∏è when doing some refactoring or simply when a lot of people interact with the codebase.
